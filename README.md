# Get_next_line  - C Library
## Introduction
The get_next_line project is designed to read lines from a file descriptor (such as standard input or a file) one at a time, until the end of the file or an error occurs. It is part of the curriculum at 42 School and serves as an exercise in file manipulation and dynamic memory allocation in the C programming language.

## Functionality
The primary functionality of the get_next_line function is to read lines from a file descriptor and return them as strings. It handles various scenarios, such as reading from standard input, files, or other input sources. Key features include:

- Reading one line at a time from a file descriptor.

- Handling multiple file descriptors concurrently.

- Managing memory dynamically to prevent leaks and optimize performance.

- Providing a bonus version (get_next_line_bonus) with additional file descriptor support.

## Result
Actual Status : finished.
